This is my first time listening to a Travis Scott album. I'm going to be honest — this is not my type of music. Personally, I'm more into EDM and experimental stuff, but I really wanted to explore more genres. So I asked some of my friends, and one of them recommended this... so here we go!


## First reaction

First of all, the album's start is okay. There are some ideas that are really good, but it needs a lot more to turn into something big — like holding all that power and delivering bigger and bigger tracks. *Stargazing* and *Carousel* are decent openers. Not that interesting, but a great way to introduce you to the concept.

*Sicko Mode* is a classic. I've already listened to it, and I really like it — just that.

Now *R.I.P. Screw* and *Stop Trying To Be God* — wtf, Travis! Dude dropped two heaters in a row. And if I'm being honest, that’s what I’m looking for. Production and instrumental-wise, these two tracks really shine a lot from all the others in the album.

After that, getting three not-so-special songs feels like a chill space. They’re okay, but listening to them outside the context of the album isn’t something I’d do. Still, I respect that, considering this is a full conceptual album.

*Astrothunder* and *Yosemite* are really good. This is the moment when I thought, “Dude, wth — why didn’t I pay attention to this before?” Both are great tracks, and they really stand out compared to the rest of the album, kind of like the earlier tracks I mentioned.

Going into the last part of the album, I noticed how well-crafted the story is. Even though they’re not “ultra super creative awesome tracks” for me, I can understand what Travis is trying to express with all of this. *COFFEE BEAN* is an awesome closer.

## Conclusion


After listening to the entire album, I can say that I've been missing out on a lot of great music from Travis Scott. In terms of production and beats, you can feel that the whole team put a lot of effort into turning Travis' ideas into something all listeners can experience.

I know vocals are one of the main focuses in trap music, and I’m going to be honest — most of the time I wasn’t blown away by them. Not because the lyrics were bad, but because I personally appreciate it more when musicians can share their ideas purely through melodies. And I could really feel that with *Astroworld*.

As someone who’s not a fan of trap, I can’t say I’ll re-listen to the whole album — I’d be lying. But I can definitely enjoy some of these tracks individually. ❤️
